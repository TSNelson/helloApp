# helloApp
Demo app for DevOps workflow using Node, Express, and Docker
see the dockerDevOpsNotes.txt file for an explanation of some of the concepts, details concerning the practical implementation of the workflow, and the commands you need to know to build the docker images and containers.

The latter part of the course that covered these concepts goes into more depth on pushing an app to production. Next steps on the project would be to complete notes on pushing an app to production.

Another extension of this project would be to create a starter kit project for a containerized node app.
